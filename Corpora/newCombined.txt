+an ancient path
in a sky without time
departing geese~

+her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
merging~

+Saturday night~
+the sound of weeping
seeps from the wall~

+before dinner~
+the spider and a fly~
+share the sunset~

+he kissed me
on the fourth of july
fireworks!~

+crossroads
the brown core
of an apple~

+lifting fog
the face of an old friend
on my morning walk~

+daybreak~
+still sipping bitter coffee~
+we rehash last night~

+stars at dusk~
+a spray of willow buds
by the gate~

+the moon
not quite full
but full enough~

+flecks of dust drift
in stifling air~

+tense meeting~
+my chewing gum
out of flavor~

on his napkin~

+against the glass~

from his lips~

dreams
undulating~

passionately all night~
+the sounds of traffic~

+imagine
a field of dandelion fluffs
before the wind~

+it expects to top
the subway stairs~
+the moon~

+nobody sees
the red persimmons
abandoned garden~

+hurry up
to cross the trail~

after plum alcohol
collected in his garden~

+breathing deeply~

in the rain~

+early morning
watching the fog
after marriage~

+more than the shining sun
in the morning~
+I want her~

+nothing more tiring
than Being tired of sleeping alone~
+warm coffee~

+crushed mosquito~
+red line on the floor~
+subway in may~

+spring wind
on my neck~
+cooler than your breath~

+the coin
as cold as the machine
which to me made~

+Black jacket
under trees
with pink flowers~

+in the train
all the scents of the morning
overshadowed by the tramp asleep~

+the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits~

+I do not like winter~

+nose in the air
fixing the invisible~
+bum perched~

on his hospital bed~

+my cold bed~
+my skin looking hers
first flakes~

+stroking the cat~
+a cold drop~
+my neck~

+sad smile
the line of bum who sleeps
on the subway platform~

+her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light~
+even fresh flowers, fade~

+a cockroach scurries
pool-side~

+my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog~

+his old hands

from the trees~

+no moisture~

in the mist~

+Mekong river

the moths reflection
in the cat's eyes~

in the old crystal flutes~

in her belly~

in the second-best vase~

at the smallest grave~

just before the rain~

in the birdbath~

+Rain on the forest~

+the courtship songs
of so many birds
wind through my shirt~

+the crunch
of the first leaf
a sweet sigh~

+the sound
of the first fallen leaf~
+this Autumn day~

rain and wind on the island~
+another insomnia night~

+Soft rain~
+her thoughts of lost love~
+intrude into her day~

+He looks at her
underlying chill in the air~
+smell of rain~

+Another day without him
she misses all the little things
still, the sun shines~

+3 am
a scycle moon~
+thoughts of him
crowd my brain
and takes my sleep~

+cancer clinic visit~
+day breaking from the night~
+a seaplane is waiting~

+feelings of joy~
+float in and out
red seaweed~

+Counting the shades
of grey in the sea
and in his hair~
+Comptant les teintes
de gris de la mer
et de ses cheveux~

+scent of rain~
+a whale-shaped cloud~
+hangs over the bay~

+On the pillow~
+his bouquet of wild flowers~
+this last day of Spring~

+Dusting off the ancestors
and stirring up memories~
+Spring cleaning~

+Another day of rain~
+her tears fall also
which is which~

+waiting for the sun~
+the clouds hide his face
first cup of coffee~

+awake at 3 am
she drags her kimono
from room to room~

+Cancer clinic visit~
+a bald woman passes by
with a smile~

+a milky sea~
+mass of logs sit and rest
as an eagle soars~

+finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest~
+freckles on my face~

+From the tidal pool
Two crabs in an embrace~
+Today's lunch~

+Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls~

+lulled to sleep
by gutter sounds~
+spring dreaming~

+Dawn~
+The night separating from the day~
+A bird's song~

+On the table~
+Apple blossom branches
A new scent~

+Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain~

+In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand~

+Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a senior's complex~

+Soft rain~
+My Mother and I look
At retirement homes~

+Rainy February day~
+Cloud after cloud after cloud~
+Pray for a clear day~

+Chilly morning~
+Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind~

+Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono~

+Awoken at 4 am
The honking of Canada geese~
+Spring is here~

+a cold morning~
+goose honks echo
off the pavement~

+Snowballs~
+her seasonal cookies
eaten one by one~

+Grey surrounds
wind blows in from the window~
+Advents candles blow out~

+Winter solstice
too many things to do
this shortest of days~

+On the island~
+the first snowfall~
+red gloves~

+First mandarin~
+sweet and sour taste~
+scent of Christmas~

+Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue~
+thoughts fly to you~

+A wind up frog~
+hops across the wooden floor~
+thoughts of haiku~

+On the weight scale
too many extra pounds~
+Autumn's abundance~

+Summer's day~
+the clink of ice cubes
in my gin and tonic~

+Crunch, crunch, crunch
stepping on fallen acorns~
+this Autumn day~

+steamed milk~
+snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof~

+Rain clouds~
+patches of blue in the sky~
+first cup of coffee~

+In the morning darkness~
+coffee cup in hand
missing the sunshine~

+Fall morning~
+fog resting on cedars~
+cup of Kona~

+Fall afternoon~
+the boat on the river~
+slow heart beating~

+Hazy skies
the cedars less dark~
+this Summer day~

+Crickets in the garden~
+time passing me by
Mother's ageing hands~

+My son's birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away~

+cloudless night~
+she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles~

+Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red~
+first cup of coffee~

+(Rain filled morning~
+i hold my face upward
tears like rain~

+conformation~
+the steady drip~drip~drip~drip~
+of maple sap~

+between the yoga
and chi gung classes
scent of burning sage~

+Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes~

+visit to the old villa~
+the scent of
lost money~

+After the Solstice
already feeling the touch
of Winter~

+The red breasted bird
outside the cancer clinic~
+Spring nest building now~

+Dark spring morning~
+busy conversation of birds~
+awakens interest~

+Morning sunshine bright
chases all worry from cancer~
+operation success~

+Dancing in the yard
rows of tidy daffodils
oh so very yellow~

+A float plane
divides the Canada geese~
+Summer stillness~

+Summer solstice~
+the smoke of bonfires
hill after hill~

+Spring cleaning today~
+dead ladybug on the window~
+memory of lost love~

+dawn storm~
+a bit of mountain ash
stirred into the snow~

+Cold sea
and warm air merge~
+fog horns~

+scent of seaweed~
+drifts into the cemetery~
+i walk alone~

+In the cemetary
around his headstone
first snowdrops~

+a slow walk
to the cemetery~
+memory of blue irises~

+Through the fog~
+a few spots of red~
+first Robins~

+Old chestnut tree~
+white candles sway
Spring wind~

+Ides of March~
+her letter to him
pain in his heart~

+Lights of the ferry
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow~

+The full December moon~
+he counts his birthdays
snow on the temple~

+The Advent wreath~
+candles lighting the dim room~
+his old eyes shinning~

+horizonless~
+sky-colored ice~
+turns in the bay~

+November morning
counting the many~
+shades of grey~

+Chilly morning~
+mountains topped with first snow~
+warm coffee cup~

+Snow covered temple~
+lone woman in a red coat~
+kneels to pray anyway~

+Indian Summer~
+his voice in the fall
of the leaves~

+Through the pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing
Start of a sunrise~

+The rushing river~
+full of the Summer's
rainfall~

+The Budapest square~
+Autumn leaves drift here and there
on young protestors~

+Dark August sky
the moon an orange egg~
+her shadow trailing~

+Summer morning~
+the sound of wind chimes
on every balcony~

+This Dark and grey day~
+a soft rain falling down on
the heat-dried roses~

+sharp air~
+the patch of blue~
+changes shape~

+Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back~

+Rain-laden cedars~
+my skin feels so moist today~
+scent of yellow rose~

+On this dark grey day~
+my thoughts wander to a pair
of blue irises~

+A bone scan today
on the way three birds on the
rose scented old path~

+Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in~

+Late night jazz~
+the singer's voice sounds dark
in the smoky cafe~

+the voice of the singer
looks black
in the smoky cafe~

+Five years of haiku
in a large paper box
on top, the cat~

+The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound
making my bed~

+A Rainy cool day~
+promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu~

+daylight moon~
+the shadows of bubbles
under the ice~

+Belated and elated
your gift of a blue candle
for my birthday~

+In the early morning
down on the white beach~
+a turtle without eyes~

+Heavy March rain~
+the Daffodils hang their heads~
+my heavy thoughts~

+Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall~

+Moon over cedars
in the rainforest~
+scent of you~

+Cherry blossoms~
+patients line up at the clinic~
+sweet scent~

+In the rainforst~
+moss hung trees~
+sound of silence~

+I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day~
+International Women's Day~

+Late Winter~
+the yellow roses still out
soft feel of snow~

+In a vase~
+twelve blue irises~
+late winter storm~

+fog patches
a second little face
in the sonogram~

+March sunrise~
+rays of red and gold through clouds~
+a fishing boat returns~

+Yellow Winter roses~
+mist over the garden~
+sound of fog horn~

+At midnight
the fog horn in the mist~
+yellow roses~

+What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground~

+Spring day~
+cool and grey~
+cup of tea~

+Grey today~
+the waves rush
memories~

+Spring morning~
+your hand on my breast~
+a bird~

+Parting the fog~
+blue nose of the ferry~
+homeward bound~

+Autumn sky
many layers of clouds
pile of leaves~

+Autumn sky~
+shades of pink and purple~
+field of pumkins~

+spin cycle~
+snow flakes swirl outside
the laundromat~

+First day of autumn~
+splash of a spawning salmon~
+another cycle begins~

+Last day of September~
+bay and islands in fog~
+aroma of coffee~

+First day of October~
+the morning sun in my eyes~
+clank of the furnace~

+A fine mist
covers the tall cedars
foggy glasses~

+At breakfast
after first sip of coffee~
+i notice a rainbow~

+Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air~

+Over the bay~
+August full moon rises
as days shorten~

+Reading a book~
+a sudden brightness~
+the full moon~

+High winds~
+trees down on power lines~
+no morning coffee~

+On a grey day~
+a spot of colour~
+his red hair~

+lifting fog~
+a few white feathers
in the raven's breast~

+In the room~
+white lillies in the vase~
+scent of pepper~

+Federal Express~
+reaches me through the fog~
+plumeria lei~

+Talking with you
now this morning somehow~
+scent of plumeria~

+Red as the poppy~
+maple leaves fall
on the memorial~

+Light-studded ferry~
+passes in the starless night~
+another week-end~

+A tunnel of fog~
+connects the two islands
warmth of my duvet~

+October morning~
+a new pair of new wool socks
on my very cold feet~

+First day of Autumn
even your touch feels
somewhat cooler~

+Last night of Summer~
+the bright full moon of last night
hidden by a cloud~

+All my lights off
to watch the rising
of the Harvest moon~

+bank thermometers~
+the temperature changes
all the way home~

+The sunrise~
+fresh salmon on ice
so very pink~

+Midnight and full moon~
+my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner~

+The blue iris
colour changing hue~
+soft Summer rain~

+A sea change~
+the weather turns cool~
+hot rum and lemon~

+At last some sunshine~
+blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water~

+In this desert
a memory of blue sea~
+shells in the sand~

+Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance~
+she cleans her glasses~

+In the forest~
+patches of blue between
the tall pines~

+The tall pines
etched against the sky~
+late September~

+Nun and monk
watching the blue heron~
+fishing in the bay~

+subzero
the icicles filled
with moonlight~

+Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues~

+The curved cheek
of the young monk~
+sunlight on the bay~

+rainy day
in the rainforest~
+drip, drip, drip~

+the seasons change
she buys new~
+colour contacts~

+winter night~
+hot buttered rum~
+fog on glasses~

+grey sea and sky~
+she dreams of
blue irises~

+after the party~
+a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift~

+Wind howls and
the cedars sway
drunken sailors~

+An ocean breeze~
+flips through empty pages
haijin's notebook~

+long after
the witching hour~
+a candle flutters~

+the wolf howl lingers
fades into the night's~
+eerie silence~

+long cold snap
the icicle
begins to fork~

+Pressed among pages
of old dictionary~
+a list of action verbs~

+one hundred views
of the sunrise~
+appartment block~

+predawn~
+a grey dove outside
my window~

+solstice~
+a shaft of sunlight
through rock~

+rainburst~
+thoughts of you
fading~

+straw hat~
+flowers fading
under the sun~

+New sheets.~
+I remember
your hands~

+shaking the stone from her shoe~
+a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts~

+summer butterfly~
+a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze~

+soft jazz~
+candle light and lip gloss
in the corner~

+low clouds
a gull circles above
the police car light~

+Earth Day~
+slowly the anesthetic
takes effect~

+August 6
my father does not say
good morning~

+cloudburst
the last nail hammered
in the rain~

+autumn chill
the mausoleum covered
with sparrows~

+autumn chill
the chalkboard screeches
at her touch~

+signal station~
+a woodpecker taps
in the dusk~

+snow flurries~
a blue jay's feather
clings to the yard~

+snow glare~
+onion bulbs sprouting
from the bag~

+geriatric ward
the table groans
when they fold it up~

+sun dog
so many names
carved on the cliff~

+snowy banks~
+the drifting duck leans
into a curve~

+Easter~
+an anxious mother calls
in the wind~

+breathless~
+camellias falling
one by one~

+starless night~
+Las Vegas spills
over the desert~

+fragile morning~
+a blue psilocybin in the middle
of the garden~

+dusk
the space between us
filling with snow~

+spring wind
the magnolia sweeps
the sky~

+night shift~
+he tree frogs sing a road
through the forest~

+a dark horse
with a blue harness~
+winter solstice~

+cold spring~
+burnt waffles
and raspberry jam~

+mid-summer~
+the nighthawk cries between
Pittsburgh and heaven~

+a long split
in the black inky cap
snow clouds~

+on the roof late~
+my brother hammers nails
in the moon~

+home for Christmas~
+the fruitcake we always
pretended to like~

+autumn leaves
my fear
of falling~

+cold moon~
+the sound of my words
in her eyes~

+the heat~
+a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight~

+trick or treat~
+I promise the vampire~
+the dog won't bite~

+fireworks over~
+the silence
of the stars~

+walking home
after the rainbow~
+a crescent moon~

+Omaha Beach~
+the sound of wave
after wave~

+Memorial Day~
+old enough to remember
a time between wars~

+dusk
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam~

+monsoon season raindrops dot the dust~

+Memorial Day~
+we try to remember
when the war began~

+drifting from dream to dream hazy moon~

+she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise~
+black no sugar~

+children's voices
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed~

+her obituary~
+the things we did
that summer~

+a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk~
+Easter morning~

+snowmelt~
+my neighbor and I forget
we're not speaking~

+brightening sky
after the eclipse~
+a skylark's song~

+steady rain
a little salt
in my beer~

+season's end
the scent of fish~
+drifts downstream~

+crescent moon~
+the new home still full
of echoes~

+first pussy willow~
+I open my notebook
of unfinished poems~

+the curved back
of a garden Buddha~
+winter rain~

+year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve~

+deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall~

+autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits~

+autumn leaves
I follow
their drift~

+where the carpet
is wearing thin~
+autumn sunlight~

+as old as I feel
on a gray morning~
+autumn equinox~

+evening calm~
+her garden the color
of moonlight~

+new coolness~
+a cloud passes through
the mountain notch~

+awake
in the dark~
+the darkness~

+narrow path~
+I make way
for the butterfly~

+coming home~
+the scent of the ocean
before the sound~

+Labor Day~
+a fly buzzing around
the leftovers~

+poor neighborhood~
+a dog barking at the end
of a rope~

+vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku~

+steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be~

+class reunion~
+an old friend's glance
at my name tag~

+Easter vigil~
+candle flames tremble
at our breath~

+just passing through~
+a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind~

+soft rain~
+fishing line parts~
+a cloud of gnats~

+train window
the landscape coming
to a stop~

+almost spring~
+her pink scarf taken
by the wind~

+a furniture store
where the church used to be
vernal equinox~

+midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight~

+waving goodnight
after the party~
+the chill~

+the white coffin~
+she was buried in
this winter light~

+first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood~

+harvest moon~
+the things I have left
undone~

+harvest moon~
+she tells him
she's late~

+downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette~

+evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea~

+twelve years old~
+learning to pronounce
Hiroshima~

+an infant asleep
on her mother's lap~
+this heat~

+the silence
around our words~
+fireflies~

+winter moon~
+a tired old man
in the mirror~

+the laughter of children
running uphill~
+Gettysburg~

+waiting up
for their teenaged daughter~
+distant fireworks~

+evening rain~
+she lets down
her hair~

+at the end
of a long afternoon~
+my faded shadow~

+awakened
by moonlight~
+an old regret~

+only the wind
off the ocean~
+Omaha Beach~

+how quickly
the nights grow longer~
+fireweed in bloom~

+a few petals
left by the sweeper~
+sunset clouds~

+locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils~

+under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions~

+another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed~

+powdering the dog~
+a child asks if fleas
go to heaven~

+Valentine's Day
shaking the snow
from the roses~

+a toast
to the departing year~
+snow turns to rain~

+after a storm~
+the absence
of a tree~

+waiting room~
+the steady hum
of the fish tank~

+in the nursing home~
+she talks about the brother~
+no one talks about~

+winter temptation
in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes~

+the evening train
almost empty
sundogs~

+the morning sun
on grandma's grave
first butterfly~

+writer's block~
+staring out the window
at snowflakes~

+Easter Sunday~
+the carefully trimmed beard
of the young priest~

+reading
the tea leaves~ the gray
in her hair~

+the doctor wants
to take a closer look~
+coffee gone cold~

+good news
from the cardiologist~
+autumn butterfly~

+dusting the books~
+I'll read when I have time~
+winter solstice~

+outside
our bedroom window
falling sleet~

+dried leaves
hurry down the path~
+standard time~

+sleeping late
this autumn morning~
+the bed half empty~

+week of rain~
+the henna tatoo
fading fast~

+crisp wind
the taste of the apple
just after picking it~

+on the beach
by the ancient city~
+sand castle ruins~

+rain
mixed with snow~
+spring equinox~

+Valentine's Day~
+we let the champagne
go flat~

+her head~
+bent over tea leaves~
+how old she's grown~

+long winter~
+my wife slows her pace
to mine~

+undressing for bed~
+I find a hole in my sock~
+the winter wind~

+returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love~

+morning prayer~
+the patter of rain
as I reach amen~

+teenagers
exchanging promises
summer's end~

+low tide~
+a shorebird's call
rises from the mud~

+75 today~
+I walk through a puddle
because I can~

+her Alzheimer's~
+a dragonfly~
+goes~ comes~

+last of his line~
+the year of his death
still uncarved~

+snow falling
on the headstones~
+just and unjust wars~

+petals in the wind~
+my neighbors practice tai-chi
in the parking lot~

+first firefly~
+she asks me to repeat
what I just said~

+wrinkles in the bedsheet early dawn~

+first light~
+after the car alarm
birdsong~

+I like the way she asks me
if I twitter~

+a trace of Shiki~

+Sunday drive
all the rain clouds

+quiet Sunday~
+a winter fly
too slow to kill~

+old photo~
+I recognize
my father's silence~

+hard times
the car salesman's
missing tooth~

+starry night
one firefly
after another~

+Assisi sunset
pilgrims gather
at a gift shop~

the tip of my tongue~

a rose~

Memorial Day~

across the highway~

+a spider web~
+caught in my hand~
+scent of rain~

+thin crescent~
+I wonder what
she meant by that~

+packing up the creche
one of the wise men
is missing~

+cold moon~
+a carriage horse trots
up Sixth~

+cold moon~
+the glitter of city lights
in the river~

+thin crescent~
+she closes
the curtains~

+whistling kettle
snowflakes
in the wind~

+cold rain~
+lavender neon surrounds
a sex shop window~

+twentyfourseven
an empty laundromat
at dawn~

+overtime~
+through an office window
the harvest moon~

+a night of fireflies
and cricket song~
+the end of summer~

+a damp evening
each of us with
our own cloud of gnats~

+rain on the lake
turning down
the volume~

+where do I
put the accent
Hiroshima~

+brookside~
+whales are roaring
in a poem I read~

+sudden shower
cursing the umbrella~
+he left at home~

+outside the wall
around the cemetery
long grass~

+mother's day~
+something sexy
for his wife~

+war news~
+I wash the ink
from my fingers~

leaves together~

+undulation
of a faded flag~
+autumn afternoon~

yellow~

+spring morning~
+those young men have noticed
what she's not wearing~

+old western~
+black hats white hats
in shades of gray~

+spring rain~
+a man standing outside
the bus shelter~

+snowflakes~
+a robin's flight
from tree to tree~

+serving coffee~
+she asks if I take cream~
+the curve of her wrist~

+someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls~
+the mist~

+waiting for you
at the sidewalk cafe~
+half moon~

+chemotherapy~
+she always liked the way~
+I kissed her hair~

+undulation
of a faded flag~
+autumn afternoon~

+they give me back
my shoelaces~

+storm clouds~
+the roofer talks about
overtime~

+nearly eighty~
+opening
a jar of preserves~

+long after
the funeral service~
+the unspoken words~

+dusk~
an unfinished sweater
on the rocking chair~

+sleepless night~
+the whistle of a distant train
going where?~

+Minnesota cold
even motorcycles
hibernate~

+lenghtening days~
+a bird's shadow crosses
the yellow wall~

+last straw rejection~
+the telemarketer tells me
I'm too old~

+a gloomy sunday~
+I sip my wine
and watch the rain
once on such a day~
+it was the time for love~

+poetry meeting~
+I try to read my haiku~
+a frog in my throat~

+here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights~

+voices of loons
cross the misted cove~
+call and response~

+A red berry falls
Staining the snow~
+A silent sunset~

+This dark night
Only white spots move
On the calico cat~

+spring thaw~
+water from the fridge drips
onto the floor~

+Post Office
stamped on the sidewalk~
+pink blossoms~

+wooden Buddha
with a cracked head on display~
+no buyers~

+new moon~
+lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign~

+a new month~
different seeds
on the spaniel's ears~

+ah these short nights
hardly time to see
seeds up~

+last day of the year~
+a leaf in the wind over a long
stem~

+a procession~
+the funeral of thirty one
December 2004~

+snowflake
without a word, the woman
gagged~

+the printer spits~
+Millennium phoenix
another sheet~

+blue iris~
+she watches the needle~
+penetrate his flesh~

+hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals~

+the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby
the sun on my teacup~

+dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain~

+moss growing
on the manhole cover~
+winter rain~

+wild wind
on dry sedge
what more on her mind?~

+oak stump~
+i remember the hornets~
+last summer~

+apple core
how to bottle
memories~

+though touch-less~
+the intimate rustle of silk~

+first dawn alone~
the widow eats his half
of the orange~

+overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline~

+lunar eclipse~
his eyes on her frayed~
+jeans front~

+petal gust~
the street flutist's
scrambled notes~

+blue dawn?~
+the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane~

+red lobster~
her prying glance
through the mist~

+news of his death~
+I can't stop looking
at the sickle moon~

+mixing bowls~
the shallow echoes
of bells~

+winter solstice~
+the widow tightens
her braids~

+candle drippings
on the epitaph~
+a broken word~

+granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist~

+mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoo's~
+cough louder~

+overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline~

+plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp~

+pine strand~
+flailing in night sky~
+the first low star~

+twilight rain
the blue heron mid-lake~
+somehow smaller~

+overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline~

+daybreak~
+ice between
the river stones~

+opaque windows
barring the dawn
of the new year~

+even seagulls
imitate the stones
first frost~

+the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore~
+our unsaid goodbyes~

+winter trees
waiting on the silence~
+our breaths~

+full moon~
+he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand~

+somehow
our shrinking shadows touch~
+harvest moon~

+words
we've left unsaid~
+Indian summer~

+crocus buds~
+secrets we've kept
from each other~

+cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight~
+the Milky Way~

+winter sky
the white cat's eyes
bluer~

+locking it~
+moonlight at the back
of the mailbox~

+the coming of summer~
all the petals
i brushed off my hair~

+gray spring dawn~
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones~

+this cold~
+Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window~

+this sunless spring day~
+chickadees chatter on~
my indecisions~

+watching rain~
+drum beat on window pane~
+the deaf cat~

+spring fever~
+shoots among the lilies~
+she can't name~

+mirror~
+she sees her flaws
in his eyes~

+mirror~
+her mother's lips
pursing like hers~

+between her
and his goodbye~
+sudden hail~

+from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave~

+silence~
+the evening snow falls
onto moss~

+secrets
burrowing in sand dunes~
+a pale sunlight~

+left out in the rain~
+her old haiku
on cherry blossoms~

+late winter walk~
+soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts~

+in the mist
waiting to meet you~
budding crocus~

+frosted dawn~
his words hang
over coffee~

+deep winter~
+nothing much to say
even among crows~

+on street~
+a shower of petals
for no one~

+first frost
the last of the roses
have lost their names~

+girl in Sunday dress
in her father's shadow
lost too soon~

+day after Christmas~
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits~

+distant thunder~
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf~

+blizzard~
the slanting lines, piercing lines~
+our locked hands~

+first frost
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers~

+white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call~

+turning
one leaf at a time~
+entries for memorials~

+autumn sunset~
+breaches rain-swept horizon~
as embers sizzle~

+picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave~
+nothing but fine rain~

+pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku~

+on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars~

+leaves crackling~
in her grave tiny hands sweep~
+leavings of sparrows~

+swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky~
unfinished journal~

+first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth~

+white moonlight~
+seeps into my sadness~
into a mulch bed~

+grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles~

+maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain~
+i reply to summer mail~

+folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn~
+this chilly morning~

+dawn by the river~
+we breach a wall of sand~
+the cry of a loon~

+crow browsing grass~
+steps on camellia blossom~
fractured silence~

+cloudy day~
+my thoughts stuck
on a spider web~

+concentration camp~
+winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders~

+stripping off
her sweatshirt~
+sparks in the dark~

+valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow~

+noon
the morning clouds~
+roll from the valley~

+aged painter
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush~

+tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart~
+worth more than my life?~

+This road~
+no one goes down it
autumn evening~

+Natural rhythms~
+moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green~

+Seven miles per gallon~
+Bush thanks you for
supporting the Iraq war~

+My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot~

+Cochrane Alberta~
+Coyotes howling in the night~
+Honking, geese at dawn~

+Like Custer's bugler~
+you sound the charge. Remember~
+the Little Big Horn~

+I-5 corridor~
+Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars~

+If you really love
America hang that flag
on a bicycle~

+invasive species~
+my barber points out
my first white hairs~

+slowly~
+a loon preens
in the mountains reflection~

+Atlanta traffic~
+easy to see why Sherman
burned this city down~

+a hundred streets named
peachtree~ no wonder sherman
burned this city down~

+I saw that finger!~
+yes you in the Intrepid~
+we shall meet again~

+he's a stop and go
christopher columbus in
your ford explorer~

+brooklyn bridge walkway
bombsquad found a stray backpack~
+homeland traffic jam~

+keep an eye open
for food, gas and ten-year-old~
+an amber alert!~

+the mailbox
captive in snowdrift~
+a letter from war~

+late afternoon~
+a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden~

+autumn bonfire~
+all my summer dreams~
+scatter with the smoke~

+growing darkness~
+gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern~

+waiting~
+dandelion fluff
lands on the table~

+the winter sun
in the cancer ward~
+a quiet old couple~

+old pond~
+another lily
in bloom~

+One just sits
And blue dawn light floods~
+his poor house~

+Soprano, clear and cool~
+and pale violin float
Above the freeway noise~

+chemo patient
seeking inspiration
in a bookstore~

+November
her nipple ring cools~

+pumpkin moon~
+tai chi movements time~
+the eclipse photos~

+frost
on the pumpkin~
+lunar eclipse~

+earthquake
with the typhoon more coins
at the temple~

+Memorial Day~
+a shadow for each
white cross~

+a twilight sun
between two peaks~
+white lilacs~

+spring moonset
a rice ball for
breakfast~

+in the grasses~
+crickets calling
the full moon~

+Eating alone
The sound of cold milk~
+Into a glass~

+in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam~

+hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news~

+winter bleak
under the rail bridge~
+graffiti blooms~

+left padlocked
under streetlight~
+orion's bike~

+past the pleiades the silent flight of many white birds~

+christmas lights~
+high above the street a skein
of twilight geese~

+in the walled garden~
+the scent
of decaying apples~

+boardwalking
the dragonfly's shadow~
+drops through a crack~

+another day~
+another apple crumble~
+~ autumn deepens~

+Heavy the heads of darkened sunflowers, I wonder, how long do I have~

+autumn days~
+the weight of my life's
unpicked apples~

+hindsight
a field of
cut stalks~

+tree burl~
+summer reveals~
+my old scars~

+our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond~

+wind chime~
+my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot~

+fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener~

+double espresso, the wail of sirens on a sultry night~

+i wait for the weather forecast, wiping sunflower pollen from the windowsill~

+water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light~

+in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky some
passing clouds~

+leaning over the fence our late neighbour's rose~

+solstice day~
+park grass pale
where the fairground~
+rides had been~

+two swans
the progress
of twilight
along the river~

+forget-me-nots~
+our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars~

+remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze~

+day break
half a pale blue~
+egg shell~

+good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear~

+how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls~

+Holes in the cloud. A shade of blue I've never seen~

+flashing against
the winter killed grass~
+a swan's whiteness~

+Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home~

+Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase~

+One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase~

+no bag we wrap the leeks in the obituary page~

+all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine~

+unsuspected metastasis moss on the roof tiles~

+hard frost all the new benches graffiti-tagged in silver~

+work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels~

+faltering resolutions the roof gutters still full of last year's leaves~

+the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet~

+April~
+a gull's cry passing
through morning snow~

+rattling white in my eye socket a half moon and two aspirin~

+Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles~

+Moss on the roof~
+tiles. First one cat
then another~

+i go to bed you stay downstairs
the windscreens ice over~

+year's end~
+there's a hearse
in the fast lane~

+geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed~

+double whisky~
+everything glistens
in the mist~

+overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen~

+wind chime~
+a text brings news
of his death~

+frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight~

+spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run~

+glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard~

+roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn~

+in the hedge~
+the lighted windows
of a train~

+in dark river water, shapes of things from the human world~

+somewhere beyond our chilli pepper plant the red dragonfly's home~

+even after 30 years~
+the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night~

+into the space between thoughts falling rose petals~

+monday morning~
+ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose~

+full moon~
+a pear hanging~
+this side of the wall~

+starless night~
+the cyclist
without lights~

+sunny afternoon~
+the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice~

+hawk, on a fence post.
first light~
+the rain a kind of mist~

+day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier~

+muggy night opening another window to let in more insects~

+sunglassesheadphones the world beyond~

+a blue-black feather glistens with rain another unexplained bruise~

+high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog~

+grey skies our late neighbour's pink roses reach over the fence~

+not long till sundown
into the willows~
+a yellow frisb e e~

+sunlight in the snail trails my glittering career~

+another cloudy night~
+i google
the moon phase~

+water changing
into ice~
+the pale moon~

+sunless days~
+the world locked in
a pine cone~

+easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails~

+neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber~

+plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind~
+elsewhere~

+spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag~
+puffs out its chest~

+in the grey of relentless rain~
+his shaved cranium and huge red headphones~

+on the brickwork graffiti, and marks that say ivy was here~

+new moon i hear about it first via twitter~

+red tulips in the vase on TV another cosy murder show~

+winter solstice
inside the hollow tree~
+fire blackened~

+Zen garden
after each storm~
+a clean slate~

+hazy afternoon~
+the woodpecker's call
bounces off the ice~

+her skin flickers in television light rain on the window~

+the proper word for brackets escapes me crescent moon~

+a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers~
+this life in exile~

+hard frost~
+deep in my coat pocket~
+summer sea-glass~

+that same music
again and again
winter rain~

+the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog~

+icebleak~
+no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti~

+still life~
+at the lake's edge a tree's reflection~
+caught in the ice~

+november sun~
+leaning on the old stone wall~
+a shadow tree~

+winter solstice~
+the pink tongue of a cat~
+lapping at snowmelt~

+dusky clouds
a patch of blue~
+hangs over the valley~

+demi-lune~
+la glace craque~
+sous les pas~

+war memorial~
+snow has almost covered
the poppy wreaths~

+antique store window
looking at dirty street snow
through colored bottles~

+the heart-shaped tracks
of a moose~

+white clouds drift
in the August sky~
+a child dreams~

+tan lines
and coconut oil~
+high tide~

+restless night~
+the morning starts
without me~

+familiar names~
the warmth of a woodstove
in January~

+fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon~
+shades of easter egg~

+A lull in the storm~
+the woodpecker darts
to another tree~

+The thyme
has gone to seed~
+summer's end~

+things come and go
raindrops
on the pine~

+my stone Buddha
sits in the dark~
+snow, snow, snow~

+cherry petals
flying higher and higher~
+storm in my valley~

+returning birds
three notes pass through
morning fog~

+a cup of tea
and a koan to go~
+my cold morning~

+severe frost~
+the sparkling whiteness
of my brown roof~

+autumn deepens~
+I wonder what my neighbour
is writing today?!~

+voices of autumn~
+the patter of raindrops
on my rooftiles~

+first cicada~
+the hot day seems
even hotter~

+red poppy dolls

+dead children of Tohoku~

+politicians play
the same old games~
+long rainy season~

+late spring~
+the old kettle
still shines~

+earthquake night~
+the stars are as silent
as ever~

+december sky~
+a jay's voice~
+shrill blue~

+only thing blacker
than raven's wings: eyes dark
enough to steal the sun~

+old rosary~
+the diary
of her hands~

+going the wrong way
down the street~
+a mockingbird~

+losing track of place
on patchwork quilt
despite dropped crumbs~

+[insert perceptive~
+seventeen syllable verse

+a small hand~
+reaches for the stars
moon bounce~

+valentine morning~

the lovebirds~

+in an old diary
between pages~
+withered rose~

+hospice visit
the daffodil stems
in a clear vase~

+squirrel's delicate~

a way to get to know
new neighbors~

+shyly, the lily unfolds
her petals~

+she's plucking eyebrows
from the wall mirror like an
escher drawn escher~

+spring breeze~
+smell of flowers and
starch~

+this longest night~
+knitting the baby's blanket
into socks~

+bottoms in the air~
+a line
of missing ducks~

+half moon~
+dog's bark above
the factory noise~

+what wind finds you here
begging shadows, coins tapping
songs for an alley~

+growing sideways
in the deep forest~
+a single birch~

+skeletons of the aspen~
+snowflakes dance
the winter away~

+sipping green tea
from a styrofoam cup~
+stomach in knots~

+the blue-eyed cat, gone
was it coyotes
or that flock of big ravens~

+freeing the ego~
+doesn't mean abandoning
your love of peaches~

+clank of iron~
+two butterflies ascend
in their mating dance~

+black cars drive themselves
suits, wind flutters pages, me
buried in my clothes~

+curls of smoke~
+rise from my coffeepot.~
+the soft patter of rain~

+drifting
with the snow~
+a plastic bag~

+a silver scimitar
new moon slices~
+night blue sky~

+rabbits at market~
+their furs pulled off like mittens~
+shiny, newborn limbs~

+little windfall apples~
+cartoon cherry bombs
that went pffft~

+frost on morning glass~
+winter's gentle face, voices
whisper through windows~

+on both sides
of the cemetery fence~
+wild flowers~

+and there lies the ocean~
+so grey and deep~
+a bobbing yacht~

+i fill the feeder~
+chickadee sings~
+we are grateful~

+the dust of two towers
is slowly obscured by smoke
from a thousand towns~

+prickly pear~
+hidden in golden grass~
+still green and holding~

+a sunflower field~
+millions of tiny faces
smiling in daylight~

+a soft whisper of breeze~
+dandelions gently sway~
+fleeting time~

+small bird
on a cattail
not singing~

+night walk full moon~
+steel rails gleam
to vanishing point~

+over the hayfields~
+a barn owl floats, searching.~
+ok, i'll listen too~

+between the trees~
+swoop of coloured wing and feather
and hammock song of summer~

+his face
next to mine~
+whiskers~

+purple scented air
hovering over the lilacs~
+transient moment~

+dear c., i think i
needed your strength to get here
sorry i can't stay~

+goodbye hug
the blue of the
forget me nots~

+clay on the wheel~
+deep breath
reaching for the centre~

+budding romance~
+between them on the porch swing
a just opening rose~

+an hour's walk
and getting nowhere~
+the treadmill~

+skin against my palm~
+you trace translucent road maps
read, cartographer~

+,your flesh a fever
limning me in this way~
+i lay hold upon i~

+he shows me his tattoo~
+the tree shadow
on the sidewalk~

+strong breeze~
+clouds sweep by
the top of the tree~

+curling up
when problems arise
armadillo~

+spring recital~
+mozart on the piano keys
bird warbles at the window~

+left in the closet~
+an umbrella, forgotten~
+rain cloud emptying~

+the sweat dripping drip~
ping into your eyes like tears
for all my efforts~

+sleeping in~
+his side of the bed
still warm~

+roots of the dead spruce
reach out bony fingers~
+secret life exposed~

+spring break~
+crocus pokes its head
through the melting of march~

+radiant heater~
+a cat by the window
purrs~

+echoes of sunset
your upturned face a canvas~
+splashed watercolor~

+exchange
of wedding vows~
+the incoming tide~

+from tree-shadow to
lighted pools, startled koi: paint~
+brush lines on water~

+we will miss you~
+farewell, mr. vonnegut~
+i laughed and wept~

+bowl of tomatoes~
+first hint of ripening
early dawn glow~

+glasses on table~
+grandpa passed in june~
+only two months away~

+smile amphibian~
+servile fly crowning frog prince~
+order among thieves~

+plane ticket to france
like a "fuck thou" ode to you
if i had the balls~

+coarse white pubic hair~
+sign of fleeting time old age
now at the ready~

+to touch, be touched
is everything worth wanting
yes, there and yes, that~

+mountains, but not stone~
+white sculptures too pure for hands.~
+i break like a wave~

+a photo is all
we have of our rendezvous
between here and there~

+snow on the ground~
+streetlamps are on
at four o'clock~

+still, white cityscape~
+belies fury of last night's~
+edmonton blizzard~

+luminescent lures
draw them close to its dark mouth~
+the nightclub swallows~

+lightning eyes flashing
and your face darkens and clouds~
+thunder comes after~

+quick steps on hard wood~
+a racing heart and shadow hips~
+scream of passing skin~

+winter is a birth
of lofty expectations
for the next season~

+elton john sings
a texas love song as
first snow falls~

+time flows freely, like
water in a river, no
dam can hold it back~

+dusk rain surrenders
bright clouds bleed a war-red~
+kurosawa sky~

+graying sky soaring;
a roof above the heads of
mortal creatures beneath~

+in the hour of foxes~
+shadows slip and slink around
edges of perception~

+flesh gnaws at its chains.
tainted souls dance in rubble~
+echoes murmur in the skin~

+familiar photos on the wall
remind me of who i am
but who the fuck are they~

+iridescence
painting colour in the moist air
clouds weeping prisms~

+fall's blaze of folly
deposits rich red blood cells
on winter's bare bones~

+freshly shaved legs
and washed my sheets today
going to bed bliss~

+the smell of wet earth
streetlight halos in the rain;~
+yukatta raincoat~

+no washrooms anywhere;
crouching behind a tree~
+i can hear everything now~

+drowning in whiskey~
+she left again
and keeps leaving~

+burned trees among
the fading living~
+reminder~

+coffee with buddha~
+i talk about my worries~

below the horizon~

how much she loved
the color blue~

+she gently sets down
her daisy chain~

+school closed
fireflies gather
under the willow~

+this lambent light
over autumn fields
southbound geese~

+morning glories~
+butterflies~
+were they not right here~

+no last goodbye
so soundlessly the turtle~
+returns to the sea~

+reading her poems~
+the stillness of hummingbirds
in flight~

+wind-borne seed~
+i have
no doubt~

+a beach dune
drops a little sand~
+the autumn stars~

+a voiceless cicada~
+quivers on the reed by
the heron's nest~

+flowering briefly
you
and the spider lily~

+the poet~
+sings a new song~
+sound of rain~

+birdsong
a clothesline
dripping light~

+shore for the poet~
+shore for the poet's work~
+water lily fragrance~

+round and beautiful
the moon breathing with cut grain
slowly moves westward~

the great blue
gone from the marsh~

+familiar hymns~
+prayers worn deep
in the wood~

+autumn moon~
+turtle crawls
in the sand~

+a handful of coins
tossed for love; magic shifts
in the river depths
where a shaft of sunlight finds
the diving goldeneye~

+september mist~
+someone
i've lost~

+summer clouds~
+the steps to the lighthouse
are painted blue~

+sweet magnolia~
+spanish moss leans
with the breeze~

+more darkness

+autumn begins~

+new coolness~
+the old dog stays
closer to home~

+half moon
your half interest
in the tryst~

+seventh-inning stretch~
+a foam finger pointing
at the autumn moon~

+falling leaves~
+my friend and i~
+discuss clutter~

+gray morning~
+the concrete business
of pigeons~

+rocking chairs
chained to the porch
leaves in the wind~

+moon viewing~
+one of the garden lanterns
lights up~

+autumn wind
the leaves too
made of oak~

+all hallow's eve
moss-draped hemlocks
fade into night~

+the spiral
in a red hothouse rose~
+year's end~

+longest day
dipping cornbread
in buttermilk~

+heat wave
a fly moves slowly
away from my swat~

+brush fire~
+the sun goes down
in flames~

+withering heat
on the shed's tin roof~
+green black walnuts~

+last blackberries
again she playfully
tells me to shush~

+summer rain
waking to find the tent the size
of a mosquito~

+random beach stone
imagining
my biography~

+field of sunflowers~
+at the edge a boy
in a yellow hat~

the wisteria
doubles back~

one small step
toward the moon in the window~

+autumn moonlight
a migrant worker sings~
+his way home~

+smoke drifts
from a fajita stand~
+plaza autumn~

+the right shoes
in the wrong size~
+october moon~

+scent of balsam~
+shapes of geese
held in the mist~

+sheen of apples~
+in a migrant child's lap
her own dirty feet~

+my mother braiding my hair~
+i realize now
how young she was~

+walking alone~
+my face
disassembles~

+rushing home
as though you were still there
autumn dusk~

+autumn leaves
the songs we learn
as children~

+the desert stars~
+i almost believe
his forever~

+a neighbor's dog howls
with the sirens~
+night heat~

+the ocean's roar
on the forest hike~
+my second-wind~

+dry thunder
one yellow leaf trickles
from all of the green~

+fluffy seed pods~
+the evening air heavy
with party chatter~

+death valley~
+a man who's never been there
tells me all about it~

+as great
as the grizzly~
+the fear~

+sand fishing
the long shadow
attached to his heels~

+your cologne~
+lingers on my skin~
+day moon~

+summer's end~
+we topple a pyramid
of beer cans~

+choke cherries~

through the flesh~

+her permission
to be blunt~

of wild onion~

of the story~

at the halfway mark~

through a screen~

+pulling
the push door~

+the road disappearing
into wetlands of mist~
+i keep going~

+the scent of turned earth
across seeded fields
twilight~

+the white bob
of a rabbit's tail~

+spring wind
our dog barks
where i m hiding~

+wildflowers
i cannot name~
+most of me~

the ewe keeps watch
over the one not moving~

in my pocket~
+cherry buds~

+the best conversations
are in my head~
+rain on the windowpane~

+may rain~
+i stretch my body
over the whole bed~

+a rumor of blues running
through the caf~

+summer wind
we ask a younger couple
where we are~

+winter sun~
+i look for something useful
to do with my hands~

+icy cobblestones~
+the tinsmith
stokes the forge~

+tangled
in blades of grass~

+i ask him again
the honeybee burrows
into thistle~

+our wind
in their flag~

+lowered
on lark-song~
+his coffin~

+orange nasturtiums
the stir of life
in my womb~

in the cold grass
crickets~

+her death bed
the clackety-clack-clack
of my homebound train~

+he tells me the word~
+i m looking for
total eclipse~

+late autumn~
+a doll that lost
its sawdust~

+guttering candle~
+a whole life lived without
the northern lights~

+falling leaves
the knot that makes
two lines one~

+wetting fingers
to pick up crumbs
insomnia~

+a carpet of leaves~
+i try to remember
her first smile~

+fallow field~
+the frosted shadow
of a scarecrow~

+christmas eve~
+candles flicker through
our wine glasses~

+summer's end
the familiar scent
of the old salt cedar~

+a hummingbird
follows the falling leaf~
+my friend's untimely death~

+paper lanterns
a white eggplant glows~
+beneath withered leaves~

+simmering rice grains
in the pot~
+patter of rain~

+the cricket
stuck in a minor key~
+milky way~

+morning glory
still some openings
i haven t seen~

+9/11 moment of silence~
+the clicks
of a thousand cameras~

+the only cafe
surrounded by trucks
harvest moon~

the runnels deepen
through cordgrass~

+from one skyscraper
to the next~
+emerging moon~

+cicadas buzz
as we walk from the church~
+white dresses~

+lightning strike~
+the majestic poplar's~
+creamy heartwood~

+ashes of roses~
+what once was our secret
now just mine~

+the photograph of the view
before the view~

all those years mother hiked
behind us~

a skunk's scent
wets the night air~

+waking to the vacant o
of the wren's house~

+faded roses
some of the words~
+i can t take back~

+summer twilight~
+the red ball runs
the final wicket~

+i overtake
a duck~

his sketch stippled
with droplets~

+3:30 a.m.
a single layer
of birdsong~

+tempers flare
the x-mark on the back
of a stinkbug~

+venus and jupiter~
+the barechested fire-eater~
+taunts his crowd~

+an arc of ibis
above the harbor~
+blue sky day~

a little milk
left in his glass~

at the neighbors again

a grey cat flickers
through the grass~

+three-day beard~
+a large rock
divides the river~

+fog blurring the hills~
+to pass the time~
+we reminisce~

+high autumn sky~
+i return a greeting
from the dog~

+dusting over
dad's bowl of wheat pennies~
+late autumn light~

+winter wind~

+we talk~
+most of the rose petals
on the table~

+the barnacled flukes
of migrating whales~
+mountains lost in haze~

+far below
migrating geese
follow the river~

+parting year~
+someone has died in the house
with the shoveled walk~

+all that sound
from a single sparrow~
+winter morning~

+morning rain~

in an apology~

on the coastal route~

through his wings~

to moonlight~

a praying mantis rocks
in the warm breeze~

+smell of sedge~
+coots settling
in the reeds~

+late moon halo~
+fish scales reflecting
on my father's blade~

+the hound's tail matches
the turn signal's beat
almost home~

+whistling to myself~
+the changing rhythms
of marsh grass~

+ancient fir scar~
+a banana slug pulls one eye
inward~

+blackberry stains
on the white sidewalk~
+his urgent kiss~

+late summer talk~
+the oil lamp smoke
going in circles~

+sunset~
+the fishing boats closer
to each other~

+cracked boulder~
+an acorn~
+settles in~

+shelling almonds~
+bits and pieces of
childhood~

+on the hammock~
+floating back to its branch~
+a butterfly~

+end of summer~
+the sting of a thorn
through my garden glove~

+essays to grade
a car stirs dust
on the gravel road~

+cattail seed
floating the places~
+i would go~

+melting bitumen~
+the beetle and i
reduced to a crawl~

+smell of grass~
+a drop of sweat sizzles
on the mower~

+the smile
in his voice
starshine~

+listening to the sound
from the deep well~
+stone on stone~

+poplar seeds~
+all my dreams
coming true~

+long afternoon~
+here and there
a butterfly's shadow~

+deodorant scent~
+tonight, love~
+i am a spring wind~

drifting toward its shadow~
+my friend's last day~

+roots down deep~
+mud paddies bake
in the midday sun~

+summer dusk~
+watering the garden
then my feet~

+mountain retreat~
+a layer of dust
on all the canned goods~

+green-black sheen
of a rooster's tail feathers~
+my neighbor's new car~

+closing light
the whistles of siskins
in the fringes of the wood~

+dead end street~
+bougainvillea overflows
the chain link fence~

+broken screen~
+the house finch
looks in~

+at the entrance
to the whistle-pig's burrow~
+mountain bluebells~

+when you think
you ve heard it all~
+brown thrasher~

+we both squeeze
through the kissing gate~
+thunderclap~

+desert wind
a wire fence stretches
to nowhere~

+dry spell
the dust of sparrows
blown by the wind~

+an empty shot glass
on the windowsill
evening snow~

+heavy going
through the waterlogged field~
+clay-pigeon shards~

+a rainy slope
where legions fell~
+thistles~

+wild mint
in the spring forest~
+a chance encounter~

+rocky shore~
+the trout on my line
pulls you closer~

+cabin fever~
+bullrushes bursting
in the vase~

+shredded checks~
+the robin weaves my life
into its nest~

+warm breeze~
+new ivy leaves finding
their place in the sun~

+spring moon~
+from the street girl's hand~
+a shadow rabbit~

+crabapple blossom~
+the older twin always
one step behind~

+temperature drop~
+the way stars are
a witness~

+swollen moon~
+the sudden urge
to push~

+the fire's scent
lingering
morning moon~

+cold snap~
+waking to the creak
of house timbers~

+clatter of pipes
when i turn the tap off
snowy night~

+a hawk's cry~
+i listen
to the gathering dark~

+how strange this human body
not queen anne's lace
not thistle~

+frigid morning~
+the brittle echo
of a crow~

+winter evening
my boy calls
to say he's feeling better~

+an ancient wick
casts shadows on the wall~
+mother's soft humming~

+milky way~
+maybe tonight
i ll conceive~

+twinkling stars
again we pass the house~
+we ll never buy~

+wounded knee~
+trying not to speak
above the wind~

+the geyser erupts~
+for a moment i forget
the smell of sulfur~

+conversation
above the kitchen clatter~
+summer evening~

+stepping stones~
+a dragonfly lands
on my shoe~

+zinnias~
+why yes my favorite
was harpo~

+the dog and i
on the moonlit dock
scratching bug bites~

+august evening

the light away~

+this sky
too blue to last
chickadee~

+vertical dive~
+the ocean folds over
a tern~

+a stream begins
in the middle of the trail~
+thrush beyond thrush~

+day-long downpour~
+dressing the children
for the ex-wife's wedding~

+the longest day~
+he stills the mower
at twilight~

+rippled sand~
+each trough cradles
the glint of shells~

+midsummer day~
+tilting a longneck
all the way up~

+morning sun
the honeybee's abdomen
pulses~

+haggling over price~
+the frozen jaw
of a warehouse tuna~

+midsummer sea~
+silver ripples
from an otter's back~

+beachside caf~
+a bit of sand
in the waiter's ear~

+thunder~
+a looping inchworm's~
+rhythmic slide~

+every spring~
+the same question~
+returning bees~

+sunrise
a shoot half out
of its seed skin~

+faint scent of lilacs~
+i wonder what he means
by~

+paper cranes~
+the yellow birch unpleats
its leaves~

+beachcombing~
+a wave picks up and drops
the sun's reflection~

+lantern light
the river slips
through our fence~

+first buds~
+the oriole sings~
+its love song~

+from the secret place~
+the mother dog
with her litter~

+shadows of new leaves play
on stains of the old~

a forest road~

+in blinding snow~
+sweet silage smell
from a door left open~

+winter morning~
+the flag-draped coffins
of a few~

+winter sun
the last photographs
in mother's album~

+all day rain
a whistle of wind
breaks the rhythm~

+the ewe
nudges her lamb once more~
+ravens cawing~

+more snow~
+the nag of an itch~
+i can t reach~

+thin clouds
the ladle steams
above my bowl~

+rain-lashed valley~
+the ram's wool matted
over his bones~

+bevy of sparrows~
+a creek breaks~
+its winter banks~

+a brown leaf~
+dangles among the buds~
+the ambulance arrives~

+the darkness
of long-empty stables~

into silence~

to be faithful~

+october frost
the tread of the landlord
on crisp brown leaves~

the stoop
in her shadow~

+soldiers coming home~
+three wasps circle where
the nest used to hang~

of the bead curtain~
+the sway of her hips~

+a sioux tunic
embroidered with elk teeth
behind smudged glass~

+thin marsh ice~
+my father attempts
an embrace~

+a sparkler fizzles
into darkness~

+he whistles
the latest love song~

what to tell her~
+bruised mint~

+dog days~
+pulling off
cockleburs~

+summer's eve
i turn the glider cushion
to its clean side~

+late summer
crossing the memory
of a stream~

+beach cabanas
flapping in the breeze~
+the sound of idle chatter~

+handshake
not a kiss~
+starless night~

+summer evening
a cook in the alley points~
+his knife at the moon~

+muggy evening
a door slams shut
in the dead man's house~

+sunset~
+i absorb the stillness
in the trees~

+stars begin to fade~
+so much music
from unseen birds~

+slow train journey~
+a gull's shadow
takes the lead~

+worn out day~
+rocks the river left
on top~

+midsummer
a speedboat slices
the lake in half~

+scorching heat~
+the shrilling of cicadas~
+pierces me~

+nameless falls
a water ouzel
at rainbow's end~

+dead man's curve~
+a screech owl veers
toward the river~

+after each
turn of the page~

an explosion
of cut lilac~

a colourful bunch
of empty flower pots~

catching dawn~

+years later
mist still gathers
in the same hollow~

+a tap
on the shoulder~
+a raindrop~

+town cannon~
+a finch with twigs vanishes
down the muzzle~

+night rain
the bedroom fills
with memories~

beneath the pine~

of my friend's cat~

my boy's~
+thin shoulders~

+on a field
of ripe tomatoes~
+the empty wooden crates~

on the finch feeder~
+september rain~

+getting to know him
at his memorial~

+its descent stopped
by a child~

+a blackbird sings
to empty seats~

over the cricket pitch~

from the potato~

to touch each other~

+the butterfly's wings~
+open and close~

+what should have been said~
+how the sand pulls
from under my feet~

+temple grounds~
+one finch~
+feeds another~

+white butterflies
lost in the barley
lost in the wheat~

+long day~
+the lizard's hind leg
stretched too far~

+race weekend~
+the worn paths
to the restrooms~

+scent of rain~
+all the ways~
+we failed each other~

+palm sunday
the sound of a frond
ripping~

+bearing down
on a borrowed pen
do not resuscitate~

+a slight shake of bells
as the harness comes off
night snow~

+moonless night~
+children's muffled voices
from the snow fort~

+winter sky~
+a skein of wild birds
unravels~

+blinding ice~
+my saw releases
the scent of pine~

+spring cleaning~
+i never cared for the scent
of her letters~

+his sax echoes
in the walkway tunnel~
+warm wind~

+a wildness
blowing through the neighborhood
with the snow~

+cold morning~
+a thin cat slips in
the closing door~

+the wrong side of town~
+a paw print~
+collects water~

+cactus bloom~
+i decide to forgive
myself~

+cold spell
the man at the ballot box~
+reading nietzsche~

+both parents
in his room~
+snowy evening~

+this cold night~
+a child's hunger embedded
in pixels~

+cold winter sky
intertwined branches
of an old beaver lodge~

+the reddened snow
six ravens and a coyote
removing the elk~

+hard frost
a dumpster's lid~
+slams shut~

+the long sigh
of a pregnant girl~
+december wind~

+frozen solid
two withered leaves
overlap~

+snowy field~
+a small creature's tracks
interrupted by wing prints~

+a russian winter~
+each book weighs several pounds
on the kitchen scale~

+autumn dusk~
+i wave to a girl
waving to someone else~

+first time up this creek
the dragonflies
won t keep still~

+crescent moon~
+the beaver shreds
a lotus leaf~

+moonlit grass~
+a farmer whistles catfish
to the surface~

+our locked gate~
+earth stops the falling
leaves~

+mushrooms tilting
into each other~
+misty rain~

+a place under
the willow tree~
+autumn rain~

+autumn mist
in the beggar's hand~
+his empty stare~

+autumn evening
her seventh rejection
of my proposal~

+early frost
a scatter of termites
from tonight's log~

+new motorcycle~
+we pass through the scent
of someone's dinner~

+sun-baked grasslands
the color in the wings
of blackbirds~

+midnight~
+the last firecracker
fizzles~

+romanian village
when the dog has passed
the rooster crows~

+autumn rain~
+she lights her cigarette
from his~

+dusty hike~
+a snail also crossing
the dry stream~

+so dry~

into my socks~

+the ragged bark
of a paper birch~
+his death day~

+mother mends her shawl
with tobacco twine~
+curing season~

+crescent moon~
+the street magician's trick
finally revealed~

the rusty tractor
in a deep rut~

+a forged signature
on the mother's day card~

on a circular needle~

my self talk~

+lullaby lyrics~
+the graceful curve
of a snowfield~

+deep winter~
+the lemon seeds also
sliced in half~

+cinnamon toast~
+my boys warm
from their beds~

+after soup
the warmth
of the bowl~

+icy rain
the clatter of teacups
on a wobbly cart~

+longest winter~
+the potato basket
empty~

+snow moon~
+steam rising
off the milk pail~

+low winter moon
just beyond the reach
of my chopsticks~

+sudden chill
from across the lake~
+another loon~

+first autumn
without mother
the leaves~

+before dusk
that thin strip of light
under the clouds~

+fallen leaves~
+my old dog
finds his way~

+thanksgiving~
+holding a bite
through the prayer~

+mountain stream
two stone bridges
joined by mist~

+last leaves fall
the warmth of his voice
deep in his letters~

+voting day~
+crows on a cedar bough
shift their weight~

+first frost
the smell of dust~
+burning in the ducts~

+christmas eve
cracking walnuts for his son
and his dad~

+veranda railing
a magpie stares down
the dog~

+early morning sounds~
+the stench of the cattle truck
before it arrives~

+setting sun~
+the old man catching fish
and letting them go~

+autumn wind~
+unwinding summer's
entanglements~

+forest tree~
+lichen by-passes
an old wound~

+between fence rails
a little boy explains cows
to the cows~

+heat lightning
a beggar outside starbucks
shakes his cup at me~

+summer's last hour~
+a yellow-jacket settles
in my garden glove~

+mountain lake~
+i paddle the moon path
to your cabin~

+leaden sky~
+this dead finch~
+weighs nothing~

+sunrise at the pier~
+calamari fishermen
bowing to the sea~

+late afternoon sun~
+pigeons land
on all the heroes~

+after fireworks
the last croaks
of roosting egrets~

+first love~
+we mark our boundaries
with river rocks~

+car ride
the child draws
a silent story~

+drifting up
into old aspen trees~
+the sound of checkers~

+changing his angle~
+changing his song~
+a thrush at dusk~

+fast moving clouds~
+my grandson finds stones
that fit his hands~

+sun-warmed room~
+the patina from his touch
on the hand drums~

+a year
wiped away
dust on luggage~

+at the corner~
+the shadow~
+splits in two~

+emptying my bag~
+the pebble makes me
think of the hill again~

+a faint groove~
+round my ring finger~
+new moon~

+spanning
the canyon wind~
+california condor~

+such stillness~
+i absorb the sound
of creaking bamboo~

+the glitz~
+an ant carries~
+morning sunshine~

+the sparkle
in our conversation~
+sunshine on her knees~

+his face
shaped by the speed
of his bike~

+morning meditation~
+a moth
works the room~

+country graveyard
confetti
in the grass~

+waking up~
+the lightest speckle of rain
on the lake~

+bird song
the widening span
of my son's hand~

+spring morning~
+the art of walking beside
someone much older~

+mist under the bridge~
+the drifting shapes
of hobos~

+church graveyard~
+from somewhere close
the fragrance of lilies~

+at the centre
of constant ripples~
+a moorhen's nod~

+early spring~
+the young boys spinning
till they re dizzy~

+graveside~
+my breasts
leaking~

+waxing moon~
+the sound of a butterfly
emerging~

+spring rain~
+her finger shushes~
+my lips~

+mile high~
+adding my breath
to the clouds~

+what do i know
about the untethered balloon~
+my daughter's embrace~

+his ashes
turning into the current~
+the turtle's ears~

+early morning~
+glue sets in the shade
of the old shed~

+early warmth
in the backyard a flicker
pokes among rocks~

+that dull gleam
through the hazy park~
+a playhouse window~

+one maple leaf~
+end over end on the sand
without a trace~

+everywhere this morning~
+maple keys soaking in
the gentle rain~

+summer dawn~
+light around the windows
as at grandmother's~

+thump and screech~
+the long freight pulls out
in robin's song~

+restless pigeons~
+gentle words from a clerk
bring a hint of tears~

+crescent moon
would i look at the clouds
without it~

+how to tell
of the myriad rich browns~
+pin-oak leaves~

+persons and place
to view the moon~
+sake not quite full~

+santoka too
passed away on this date~
+wine with my tears~

+almost dry again
the drinking gourd~

+long road~
+the leaves and i
windblown~

+sunshine
the colours
of the hill~

+temple steps~
+his shoes
in the autumn rain~

+backyard pine~
+what can i do
with all these crows~

+his lantern's glow
pushing back the dark~
+frog song~

+ebb tide
the heron steps
into twilight~

+daybreak~
+a migratory bird's feather
on the path~

+love~
+a kigo for all
seasons~

+a memorial bell~
+tolls tolls and stops~
+but his words~

+blue dragonfly~
+pine needles cover
the narrow path~

+the mountain pine~
+holding the light~
+held by it~

+bill's day~
+draw the letters
in aspen-glow~

+a little cold
and without the bright fish~
+this golden pond~

+gray october
the poet's voice~
+outlives him~

+full moon
and so my thoughts
turn to you~

+vest pocket park~
+the leaves a little~
+less brilliant~

+at his passing~
+a ripple in the river
of stars~

+misty shroud~
+leaves falling
between the rails~

+sunset fades
from the highest peak~
+autumn chill~

+higginson's haiku
still among the living;~
+the autumn wind~

+a teacher's passing~
+moonlight bathes~
+the apple tree~

+another light
now~
+among the stars~

+a gentle breeze ripples
everywhere his words
leaves on grass~

+opening his book~
+the world he offered
tumbles out~

+beyond emptiness
the moon filling itself
for certain~

+autumn evening~
+adding another star
to the milky way~

+prayer flags
the autumn leaves carry
the blessings to you~

+cloudy day~
+the janitor misses
a fallen leaf~

+surf murmurs
the basso continuo
behind the dunes~

+this fragility~
+white cranes laced
in the air~

+dry autumn~
+the fading vibrance
of a spider lily~

+hard to tell you
how i feel~
+this late autumn sky~

+petrified forest~
+a stone axe echoes
in the sky~

+autumn ginko
one by one
into mist~

+harvest home~
+a red nasturtium~
+heads for the stars~

+a single breath~
+the ember
comes to life~

+leaving us in autumn~
+leaving behind him
the blossoms to come~

+ebbing tide
a bright shell caught
by the current~

+tree leaves fall
as the long journey begins
a fading hymn~

+white hydrangea
fading
in white light~

+insect chirps
lingering low on the ground~
+the later moon~

+heavy fog~
+the mountain still back there
out of sight~

+what a silence!
and nobody's around
to share it with~

+migrating birds~
+i hear his voice in the wind
toward nirvanna~

+bleu roi
a thousand flying foxes~
+quarter moon~

+walking alone
the filtered sounds
of the hototogisu~

+dusk
a half-ripe melon~
+frees itself from the vine~

+patter of raindrops
in autumn leaves~
+the seasons turn~

+his passing~
+the small fir collects
fallen leaves~

+starry night~
+a worn phone number
in the handbook~

+morning frost
a monk's chant
crosses the river~

+stalagmites
a passel of school children
up ahead~

+autumn leaves~
+in the book she gave me
an old library stamp~

+autumn gust
the starlings wings
tilt in unison~

+withered juniper~
+mother's hair
since the nursing home~

+village temple~
+kids behind the gods
playing hide and seek~

+through endless rain
the whistle
of the paperboy~

+the taste of cider
when fallen leaves begin
to overlap~

+bustling shoppers~
+the bell ringer's
prosthetic hand~

+winter solstice~
+smoothing a folded corner
in my library book~

+a single bubble
after the beaver dives
the rising moon~

+the gardener
and his scarecrow~
+the same hat~

+crows swagger
down the middle of the road~
+summer's end~

+starting school tomorrow~
+he talks to trees
at the woods edge~

+labor day~
+a spot of barbecue sauce
on the face of my watch~

+summer's end
two flies fighting
over me~

+old blue car~
+the ease
of summer's last days~

+a still, starry night~
+train tracks
wet with dew~

+scudding clouds
the snake as long
as my sleeve~

+stump speech~
+this black and white butterfly
in none of the field guides~

+thundercloud~
+blue veins down to the heart
of the gentian~

+sunburst~
+bits of river
through the mangroves~

+a whiff of kelp
as i clear out the trunk~
+summer moon~

+scenic outlook~
+each step reveals
more grasshoppers~

+jasmine in bloom~
+termites swarm
from their nest~

+bark butter~
+a nuthatch
works the edges~

+mountain slopes
getting wet as i walk
through clouds~

+city bus stop~
+the boy squats in the shadow
of his pregnant mother~

+so many ways
to see the world~
+snake in the grass~

the hawker twirls
his glow bracelets~

+the cat brings the rain
to bed~

+summer stars~
+hot buttered corn
on our smiles~

+summer brook~
+perfect skipping stone
on the other side~

the dead pony's name~

sets our pace~

friends come to visit
our tree~

+hearing his name
in someone else's conversation~

+father-in-law's death
one gardenia petal
falls in the rain~

in the lime tree

of a wave~

in the graveyard pond~
+spring sunshine~

the branches~

from hand to hand~

into a groove~

of cattle~

from their crowded crates

the poet's pen
skips~

+vitamins strewn
across my plate~

+magnolia in full bloom~
+a new tingling
in my breasts~

+angle of repose~
+a hermit thrush
fills the valley~

+songbirds in the dark~
+the sound of my sister's voice
when she lies~

+the downpour ends
first one peep
then another~

+the first bird
to break silence~
+hour of the wolf~

+icesnow~
+the stab marks
of her pronged cane~

+flashlight shadows
the storyteller's head
fills the ceiling~

+moonless night~
+the splinter deep
in my finger~

+deep winter~
+the splinter begins
to fester~

that no one believes~

for his belt~

of heavy rain~

from the branch~

around the maple
do i have to go home~

+morning chill
a child's shadow~
+moves thru mine~

+that kind of day~
+the wind at my back
most of the time~

of his own~

except for that cricket
behind the fridge~

your words carry me
across the river~

of summer~

flickering~

pond grass connected
to the moon~

the mountain rises
black with night~

slips through~

from a burning hillside~

+pushing the crocheted throw
back to her side~

down by the bayou a heron
spears a fish~

+counting an odd number
in the skein of geese~

+i return my wristwatch
to the travel bag~

coming to a boil~

in the rain barrel~

by the sharp left turn~

is laughing again~

on the windowsill~

+her answer tatters away
with the wind~
+a seagull's cry~

+every night~
+this stretch of road~
+honeysuckle~

+a common wire fence~
+then a western tanager~
+sits there a moment~

+up to their necks
in lawn daisies~
+the robin the worm~

+discussion with friends~

in the aquarium~

+reaching a wide stream~
+the trail continues
on the other side~

in the dawn~

+late august~
+the way the spider's web
bows with each gust~

+on this night of no moon~
+the white eggplant~

the white heron's harsh cry
has no echo~

+speaks for us~

+a patch of coltsfoot
amid roadside debris
the overcast brightens~

in the shadows~

to the aloe leaf~

raises a rock~

all the puddles
wash away~

+leisurely gossip~
+our neighbor's dog~
+snaps at flies~

move~

+a broader path~
+i rake away my footprints
with the yellow leaves~

of a bird~

+i fall short of being the human
i wish to be~

+wild iris~
+the water leaks
from a cracked vase~

+morning stillness~
+a dandelion seed
hovers~

+half swept away
with the dirt~

finally knocks the scarecrow out
cold~

of my mother~

through a screen~

on a dusty grass blade~
+the ant backs up~

+leaving~
+she uncoils the morning glory
from the garden gate~

followed by the sound
of a cricket~

at each sidewalk crack~

hidden by acres and acres
of sugarcane~

into the sunset~

silvered by salmon~

+tattered basketball net~
+clinging to a rusted rim~
+my childhood home~

+single mother
rocking her baby~
+rocking herself~

+cathedral at night~
+an electron circles
the nucleus~

+gibbous moon~
+my ear on the curve
of her belly~

+button jar~
+all he knows
of grandma~

+learning to weave
one breath between us
the long night~

of his new jaguar~

+after rain
the yellow of gorse~
+the black of slate~

+small town~
+the only light
is red~

+returning home
after living abroad~
+the smell of thyme~

+old barn
the scent of jerseys
and bailer twine~

yesterday's bee~

+traded
for persimmons~
+acupuncture~

+a harrier, low
over the silver-blues
of the evening marshes~

on a morning lake~

the sun mining~
+foxglove scent~

+cloudy with a chance
of jalapenos~

+sundown~
+swallowing the oyster~
+juice and all~

+a wing
in each world~
+the stingray breaks the surface~

+chigger bites~
+my finger traces
the wilderness map~

+at the cemetery
by moonlight talking
with shadows~

+walking at night~
+my imagination
follows me home~

+water-tower shadow
extending
a small town's loneliness~

+it begins~
+a galaxy of dust motes
in the projector's beam~

+the dinosaur museum~
+i have to be there
for the grandchildren~

+torrential rains~
+urchins cheer their paper boats
into the gutter~

+eclipse
our wedding rings
one inside the other~

+home alone
i enter the crawl space
of a younger self~

+clear sky~
+a bouncy castle
inflating~

+barefoot
the bride wrings seawater
out of her train~

in the summer sunset~
+minnows rising~

+out-going tide
the little portion~
+a shell retains~

what's in it
christmas morning~

+the potted plant
drops its leaves~

+snuffed out candles~
+the lingering scent
of her life~

+a barn owl banks
over golden meadow grass~
+the morning star~

the dark curve
of a red fox's tail~

the roller-shutter dawn
of factory workers~

+a sunbeam on the mat
below the letterbox~

the subtle blue sound
of snowflakes~

+i learn
by unfolding~

on the sharpened ulu~
+hunter's moon~

the owl didn't return
to the nest~

+silent night a distorted world
on the busker's sax~

+girdled maple~
+autumn already
in its leaves~

+mountain fog
a gathering fugue
of wind and pine~

+no need
to leave the comfort zone~
+harvest moon~

+leaves rustling
there goes that
crick in my knee~

+early autumn
tasseled grasses
dust the air~

+forced retirement~
+the creases in his pants
fade away~

a sudden rain
rushes the dusk~

into my cummerbund~

+happy hour outdoors~
+the complimentary
sunset~

+waterfront cafe~
+incoming tide through planks
beneath our feet~

+gathering the night
around itself
whippoorwill~

+stargazing
my fingers
grasping sand~

+buzzing neon~
+the way he talks
about new york~

+withered fields~
+the pulsing of
a lone glow worm~

+above the clamor
of starlings~
+star stream~

+old pond ice
stirred by spring wind~
+osprey feathers~

+morning drizzle
the crescent of dry pavement
beneath the pinecone~

of a pitcher plant~

once a year our angel
comes out of hiding~

+holiday cleanup
putting the last spoon
to rest~

on the cut flowers~

+here for me
on a winter night~
+the kitchen chair~

+a bat
slips into a crack~
+orion rising~

+blizzard
the last toothpick tops
the tower~

+fox tracks~
+who was i before
i was tamed~

+contrails
above brown hills
places i've never been~

+in the deep hollows
yellow leaves
linger~

+tarp-covered yacht~
+the longer shadows
of a fake owl~

+the sea
with the final say~
+widow's walk~

+in the curves
of an alto sax
amazing grace~

+thinking about how
language is made~
+the cold crow's
carrr~

+leaf raking
the swish-swish
of corduroy~

+mars landing~

to her doorstep~

+only one small~

+i start on the milky ways~

still in question~

at my daughter's grave
our shadows~

+closing my eyes
to find it
cricket's song~

+sphagnum moss
the secret to
where fog lives~

a silverfish
inside the ephemeris~

+behind me~
+the years~
+fading sunflowers~

from the old horse's back~

+an ant scurries across
three wars~

tinged with salt~

hanging from a tree limb~

of the pager~

+at dusk~
+a sailboat practices
coming about~

+contract negotiations~
+the summer we spent
in trees~

+fossil shells
inside a crumbling rock~
+long summer rain~

+evening breeze
ruffling thoughts of her
echoes of the erhu~

+still hummingbird~
+as if summer
is forever~

+evening swallows~
+the last green of summer
rolled up in bales~

+sunlight on water
vowels
in the syllables of birds~

+scent of wind~
+a lizard steps out
of its old skin~

+the smell of old sails
on his coat~

+leaving their echoes ringing
woodpeckers debugging
boards in the barn~

+the splash~
+our anchor~
+splitting stars~

+sea cave
the thoughts i keep
inviting back~

+incoming tide
the lullabies my mother
learned from her mother~

+from the ocean
to her moat~
+a bucket mostly spilled~

+those evenings
when ripeness is just reaching
the pits of plums~

+young osprey
how to land softly
with a trout~

+clear stream
the one stepping-stone
under water~

+no details
about the procedure~

direction the call
to prayer~

of pines~

clarity~

to my past~

the butterfly~

+feel of the paring blade
between my fingers~

+morning sun
stroking its warmth
through the old dog's fur~

+election fever~
+my preschooler inks his
index finger~

+indian summer~
+the bright green
of wet paint~

+cold winds the receding tempo of rain~

+crow feather~
+before dusk~
+the feel of dusk~

+the hourglass
runs faster now
an eyelash moon~

+a mist
slipping through the morning woods
coyote~

+morning sky
stars become
starlings~

+now retired
his pride measured
in asparagus~

+sweltering heat~
+plop after plop of tomatoes
tossed into buckets~

+rustling leaves
fear as old as
the forest itself~

+numberless stars
a long stick to keep
the campfire going~

+just before dawn~
+pleiades opens the sky~
+the warbler's melody~

+evening calm~
+a trout glides through a bay
of spent caddis nymphs~

+school's back~

about seeing the eagle~
+father's day~

and cigarette smoke~

of her pearl earring
summer moon~

in my braid~

now and then
mother's fragrance~

+picasso~
+i see different wife~
+my in a way~

+the winter burned azalea studded
with vermillion flowers~

+perhaps
there is a heaven~
+cherry blossoms~

+metro station~
+a wistful face at the window
in the moving train~

+first light~
+my dream mother opens
her blue eyes~

responsibility~

takes it all back~

+digging out after the blizzard~
+a crow's voice merges
with the creaking pine~

+ice storm ended~
+the height of a short man's~
+slam dunk~

+hunger
the metallic taste
of winter wind~

+pencil pine
the last of the sun~
+angles away~

+fading stars~
+stones on the beach~
+wet with dew~

+his promised
return~
+paper airplane~

+escorting
a dead dragonfly
100 undertakers~

+grain of the wood~
+their conversation
at the viewing~

+deep fog~
+a sax returns the call
of a tug horn~

+scent of applewood~
+pork bellies
in the smokehouse~

+eagle cloud~
+the mistral's breath
in my bones~

+eagle sighting
the passing trucker and i~
+share a thumbs-up~

+first frost
the scent of coffee reaching
a little further~

+the randomness
of where things fall
red maples~

+the smell of sweat
here comes
the collection plate~

+muggy evening
the whine
of the battery charger~

+fireflies~
+the sparking thoughts
of an insomniac~

+the longest drought~
+a coyote nuzzles
the jimson weeds~

+rain at last!~
+i ask the piano salesman
to riff a little bach~

+wing beats
of a pelican~
+our sails catch the breeze~

+i open my eyes
from dreams to daydreams~
+whirligig beetle~

+a pigeon
cooing circles on the dock~
+end of summer~

+evening dusk~
+the clang of pots and pans
through a marriage~

+billiard balls
on worn felt~
+the rain~

+summer evening
dusk falling
through the skylight~

+rice field~
+all these extra prayers
become stars~

+an undertone
to the orchid's scent
somewhere a clock~

+coconut grove
leaf blades comb
the moonlight~

+alpine lake~
+my breast stroke's shining arc
toward sunrise~

+spruce woods
fireweed filling
the vacancy~

+corrugated sun~
+chilies and laundry
in rooftop haze~

+home from war~
+we ease out
the champagne corks~
