in memoriam~

+an ancient path
in a sky without time
departing geese~

+her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
merging~

+Saturday night~
+the sound of weeping
seeps from the wall~

+before dinner~
+the spider and a fly~
+share the sunset~

+he kissed me
on the fourth of july
fireworks!~

+crossroads
the brown core
of an apple~

+lifting fog
the face of an old friend
on my morning walk~

+daybreak~
+still sipping bitter coffee~
+we rehash last night~

+stars at dusk~
+a spray of willow buds
by the gate~

+the moon
not quite full
but full enough~

+requiem mass~
+flecks of dust drift
in stifling air~

+tense meeting~
+my chewing gum
out of flavor~

+inhaling spring~
+her new breast
two months old~

+morning rush~
+he finds a half red kiss
on his coffee cup~

+never in darkness~
+ground zero lights the night~
+New Year's Eve~

+moonless night~
+the bell buoy~
+talks to itself~

+morning tea~
+he cups his hands
around the glass~

+winter solstice
candle too short
for lingering night~

+dying afternoon light
the doctor touches her
uncombed hair~

+snail mail
delivered
in the cold rain~

+Wedding Day~
+in the bride's eyes~
+the groom's smile~

+mother and daughter~
+chess game
two queens~

+haiku conference~
+lecturer delivers address
in three short sentences~

+haiku moment~
+she writes her number
on his napkin~

+against the glass~
+her palm prints
linger~

+sunny beach
about size
and sighs~

+on her nape~
+beads of rain
slowly I follow them down~

+kitchen encounter
tasting the wine
from his lips~

+summer sidewalk~
+drops of rain
steam~

+water bed
dreams
undulating~

+thunder~
+slate sky~
+crocus peeking~

+making love
passionately all night~
+the sounds of traffic~

+imagine
a field of dandelion fluffs
before the wind~

+it expects to top
the subway stairs~
+the moon~

+nobody sees
the red persimmons
abandoned garden~

+hurry up
to cross the trail~
+reckless snail!~

+in bottling
This slow movement
Bach~

+At the cemetery gate
three old friends
speak rheumatism~

+August full moon~
+her pregnancy test
positive~

+ever tonight
relight the candles~
+the wind blows~

+Orange nail clippings~
+Turmeric moon~

+picking blackberries~
+Balloon
in the evening sky~

+this morning~
+wet balcony
pick up the leftover wax
candle-Charlie~

+midnight rain~
+now every minute~
+the grass, greening~

+Hot air balloons rise
over the Loire
then the full moon~

+Easter Sunday~
+a nice little knot
in garbage bag~

+Celebration of Kings~
+the pine trees
homeless~

+a crow
repeats its call~
+first morning~

+Organ music
in the subway~
+her long legs~

+Basho haiku~
+grains of sand
under the pen~

+fireworks off
near the full moon
on the sea~

+sky
glittering stars~
+pavement
dull~
+chewing gum~

+midnight~
+I read haiku
about sleep~

+Night Bar~
+his nose
small bright
sweaty~

+plonk
the center of the world~
haikai~

+insomnia~
+the smell of bread
who cooked~

+ticklish course~
+insect on my cheek~
+Aircraft crossing~

+In the bowl of verbena~
+bulb ceiling~
+Mid-November~

+in the Cathedral
kneeling
the photographer~

+During Creation
Haydn~
+a spider
down from the hanger~

+Early necklines~
+already ripe fruits
April~

+subway wind
happens to raise a page~
+haikai~

+bright white~
+her blouse~
+The Ides of March~

+the cold cry
of a magpie?
first light of day~

+quick interview tonight
the plate of a
Wind Street~

+dry garden~
+traces of knife
in butter~

+Fragonard street
the white canvas~
+a sheet drying~

+leaving the sex shop~
+red leaves of spring~

+Sunday 7/1/7
the knife on horseback
on bean~

+at the door of Fauchon~
+a puddle of vomit~
+End of year~

+macro-furrow~
+the librarian~
+I look down~

+in a crate~
+'Carrots France'~
+books at a euro~

+She took dance.
Her big brassy calves
in the rain in September~

+end of the mornng~
+the mold of the fishmonger
yawn~

+winter driving
Almost blinded
by a sun-dog~

+September storm
Pressed against your back
curled up~

+180 dead, 8 attacks~
+Karachi today~
+Zidane said on TV~

+the radiator behind the door~
+July heat wave~

+Headend~
+Sikh taxi?~
+white turban~

+in empty apartment~
+the great gash of
sun ground~

+the collection of a friend~
+a Zen monk rakes
the angle of coverage~

+brown belt: his skin
between top and pants~
+Online fourteen~

+tonight a great football game
breasts that pregnant woman~

+under the bus shelter~
+old tepu Avenue~
+Rain in May~

+two ladies of a certain age~
+speak bra~
+Train May~

+sun's rise
the voices of crows
lift it higher~

+her round ass~
+amount escalator~
+half Moon~

+fringed white lake~
+February 1
to Metz~
