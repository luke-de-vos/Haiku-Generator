Source Fitting
quotes removed from the one
first word in haiku begins with +
last word ends with =
many characters that represent pauses or a logical split (such as ..., ?, --, ::) replaced with just " - "

Haiku Creation
only final line has special rules for ending
	prefers words that end with =
rest of lines are calculated normally

Output Fixing
if a determiner or personal pronoun follows an noun or adjective, a comma is added after the article or adjective

hasNext checks two ahead


problems:
POS tagger often fails
	"Winter rain the smell of"
	rain is considered a verb
	this mistake is made quite often due to that phrasing being common
ideas are choppily spread between lines, uncharacteristic of haiku
	it's usually one idea in the first line, then a contiguous phrase through the next two lines
